# Archipelago.gg -  Ori and the Blind Forest: DE
My implementation of the [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) version of Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition. It is currently in development and **not** production ready. I will also probably make a fork of the [Archipelago repository](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) and implement it there properly, but for now this repository will contain the source for the modification.

**Currently this repository is just for the codebase and not for any kind of release. There is logic connecting to the randomizer implemented here and there, but it is not completed and can therefore cause bugs and errors.**

### How to install the mod:
 - To install the mod I have forked and edited the code of the [Unity Mod Manager made by newman55](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager). You can find the version modified for the mod under [MaybeKalle/unity-mod-manager](https://github.com/MaybeKalle/unity-mod-manager). Using this version is completely optional but comes with the config already modified and a few quality of life improvements.
 - Download the latest version of the modification under [Releases](https://github.com/MaybeKalle/ArchipelagoOriDE/releases/latest)
 - Open the Mod Manager, select your Ori and the Blind Forest folder and install the manager
 - Drag and drop the ZIP-File into the Mod Manager or extract the contents in the /Mods folder in your Ori directory

### To-Do:
 - Implement an easy way to connect to a game and to be able to have multiple games running at the same time (i. e. in different saves) without having to change something everytime you want to switch between these games.
 - Implement the logic to communicate between the Archipelago server and the modification
 - Handle pickups ingame and items received in other worlds
 - (Maybe) Change the item in-game to an Archipelago icon or maybe an item like the Map Stone Fragment (?) to display an item from another player
 - Checking if the logic already made for the game is accurate and maybe change a few things based on feedback
 - Maybe more?
 
 ### Known Issue:
  - In Gumo Hideout the left Experience above the map is currently not listed as item in-logic. Going to fix that ASAP.
